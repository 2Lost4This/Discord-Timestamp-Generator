# Discord Timestamp

Always wanted to use a timestamp but don't know how to create one? Then you are exactly right here.



### What are Timestamps

These are "messages" which show a fixed time, but in the local time of everyone who reads them. Meaning if it is 1 pm for one person, it is 1 am for the other due to the different time zones.

### Why I created the tool?

First, I had nothing to do, and second, I wanted to do something new + learn. 
You can find the [tool here](https://tool.losti.xyz) 

### Can i use it?

Yes you can use it, but there is a [License](https://github.com/2Lost4This/Discord-Timestamp-Generator/blob/main/LICENSE) and you should accept it
