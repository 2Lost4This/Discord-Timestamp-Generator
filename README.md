# Discord Timestamp

Always wanted to use a timestamp but don't know how to create one? Then you are exactly right here.



### What are Timestamps

These are "messages" which show a fixed time, but in the local time of everyone who reads them. Meaning if it is 1 pm for one person, it is 1 am for the other due to the different time zones.

### Why I created the tool?

First, I had nothing to do, and second, I wanted to do something new + learn.
